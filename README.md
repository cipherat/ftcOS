# FTC Dummy Operating System
This operating system is built for fun from KSU FTClub students during Ramadan.
A bare minimum working bootloader is push'ed via git as a first commit called "The Genisis Commit", each pull request acts like a feature which will be added to the OS to develop and build

Only C & x86 Assembly is being used, utility scripts can be any other language.
