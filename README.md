# FTC Dummy Operating System
This operating system is built for fun from KSU FTClub students during Ramadan.
Each issue/pull request acts like a feature which will be added to the OS to develop and build characteristics.

Only C & x86 Assembly will be used, utility scripts can be any other language.

## But how do i run your great OS, im not as expert as you D;
bruh i even made it easy FOR THIS SPECIFIC REASON (and because im dumb and always forget how to compile stuff)
```console
[~/github/ftcOS] make build
```

and to run it, just do
```console
[~/github/ftcOS] make boot
```

Hooray!
